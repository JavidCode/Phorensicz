<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Phorensicz is a Frankfort/Louisville Ky. based Independent artist, and also member of a Hip-Hop collective know as Basement
        Up. With the group, he was apart of several projects that received attention not only regionally, but also nationally through
        the support of numerous music blog sites. His musical endeavors have also afforded him with the opportunity to open for several
        major touring acts. In early 2014, he began work on his first solo EP "Novelty Gone", and released it as a free project on
        April 30th, 2015. A follow up solo project is planned for early fall 2015, along with several other musical ventures, which
        will hopefully allow him to spread his sound to a wider audience.</p>
